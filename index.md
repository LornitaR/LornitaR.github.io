## Irish Resources

I'm very passionate about learning Irish, and have started studying it again after taking a break from it after secondary school. It's my current mission to help as many people to learn Irish, by compiling useful resources, and sharing what I've learned. This section will contain a variety of links to resources _as Gaeilge_. Some will be educational, and some are just a bit of craic.

### Timpiste

Most people who've done the Irish Junior Cert will remember having to learn how to write about a _timpiste_ (accident) at some point. [This is a random story generator](https://lornitar.github.io/gaeilge/) that [Kieran Whooley](https://github.com/kieranwhooley) and I created as a bit of a joke to practice Irish between classes. It generates a story in Irish, with the English translation below.

### Placement Tests

If you're interested in finding out your level of Irish, a few places offer short tests you can take.
- [TEG](http://secure.teg.ie/quiz/)
- [Gaelchultúr](https://www.gaelchultur.com/en/assessment.aspx)

### Online Classes

I've been taking classes with [Coláiste na Rinne](https://www.anrinn.com/adult-courses/), and highly recommend them. I've taken 2 groups of classes with them, and plan on taking more in the future, once I feel confident enough to attempt the next level. There are probably others who offer online classes, but this is the only one I have experience with.

### Dictionary

[Teanglann](https://www.teanglann.ie/en/) is absolutely fantastic as an online dictionary. Not only does it have a dictionary, but it also has a section on grammar that is constantly being updated. They also provide voice clips for some words so that you can hear how it's said in the 3 main dialects. If you get the app, you'll also get a word of the day on the landing page.

### Irish Grammar Document

Another project I've taken on is writing a large document with as much information as I can gather on Irish grammar, since this is impossible to find unless you're already fluent and can understand the [caighdeán](https://www.oireachtas.ie/en/publications/?q=An%20Caighde%C3%A1n%20Oifigi%C3%BAil). [Here](https://lornitar.github.io/gramadach/)'s what I've done so far. It currently contains all of the irregular verbs in the past, present, future, and conditional.

### Setanta Programming Language

Setanta is a programming language written in Irish. Try it out [here](https://try-setanta.ie/). Created by [Eoin Davey](https://github.com/EoinDavey/Setanta) for his FYP, this is a great project for anyone interested in both programming and Irish. The first version of my _Gineadóir Timpistí_ was [made using setanta](https://github.com/LornitaR/timpiste)

### Other Useful Resources
[Liofa](https://www.liofa.eu/learning-irish/useful-links) also has a lot of information on available resources for Irish learning.

### Irish Businesses

Here are some businesses based in Ireland that support the promotion of the Irish language:
