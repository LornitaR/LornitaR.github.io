## Irish Resources

I'm very passionate about learning Irish, and have started studying it again after taking a break from it after secondary school. It's my current mission to help as many people to learn Irish, by compiling useful resources, and sharing what I've learned. This section will contain a variety of links to resources as Gaeilge. Some will be educational, and some are just a bit of craic


### Timpiste

Most people who've done the Irish Junior Cert will remember having to learn how to write about a timpiste (accident) at some point. [This is a random story generator](https://lornitar.github.io/gaeilge/) that [Kieran Whooley](https://github.com/kieranwhooley) and I created as a bit of a joke to practice Irish between classes. It generates a story in Irish, with the English translation below.
